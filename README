This package does cross sections through 3d variables in either lat-lon grids or lambert conformal grids. The general procedure is this: 
1. Read in whatever 3d variables you want along with the coordinate variables, being lats,lons, and vertical coordinate
2. create lat and lon points for the cross section and calculate distances of these points using the "create_cross_latlon_points" routine in "create_cross_points" module
3. Calculate cross section slice with "cross section" routine in "cross_section" module
